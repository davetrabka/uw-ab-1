The kids were able to enjoy the backyard and the adults were able to hang out in the screened area and relax . I could go on and on about how amazing this place was . We will not hesitate to book again the next time we visit Missouri !! Thanks so much for the hospitality, Rob !',

Our party enjoyed the home atmosphere for the weekend as opposed to walking back and forth between hotel rooms.

The location in Boonville was about a 30 minute drive to Arrow Rock. Robert's house was comfortable and clean. He had several pamphlets about things to do and see in the Boonville area. There was plenty of room for visiting and also having space to yourself. The only caveat I would mention is it is a split level house so there are stairs to navigate when you first come in the door - half flight to upstairs for bedrooms and kitchen, half flight to finished basement with hide-a-bed. This could be a problem for people with limited mobility.",

The yard was easily accessible but we did not use it, we were mainly there at night once our daily adventures were done. The town itself did not have a lot going on aside from the Art Festival we saw on the weekend. I had to hit the gym and there was a YMCA close by that had a great facility for 6 dollars entry. However, we mainly picked this house due to the location of the Katy Trail. We were able to rent bikes right down the road and explore the trail, it was great! There was a casino just a few minutes away as well, we didn't get a chance to stop in this time, maybe next! Rob was very easy to speak with, maintained communication the whole trip. I noticed they didn't have an ironing board and he dropped one off for us.

      review: `We had a great time at Roberts place. We got in later than expected ;but still, I unpacked the bike and headed to the Katy Trail. 20 miles later I was tired but happy, having dusted off the cobwebs of inaction, limited only by the fading daylight. We'd come again for sure. Nice clean place to stay.`,

      review: `Robert was very accommodating. Check in and check out timing was able to be adjusted to meet our needs. The house was perfect for our family. The kids enjoyed having a "kid space" downstairs. The kitchen and dining area were great. We did most of our meals at the house. The house had a great location. We were able to easily access the KATY trail and cycle around town.`,

      review: `Robert was an amazing host and his place was phenomenal! Robert made sure to make our stay an amazing one by making us feel at home and even left little notes for us throughout the house to add a personal touch. Robert made sure to let us know he was always a call or text away if anything was needed and he was always prompt with his responses. I recommend Robert and his house to anyone who wants an amazing experience and a wonderful host!`,

      review: `Robert had great communication throughout the whole process. Plus he had notes on chalkboards in the house and made us feel very much at home. He has a cute and well maintained house on a quiet culdesac. Everything in house was very clean and tidy. Really liked the fact that he had a coded keyless entry door. We highly recommend Robert as an Airbnb host.

The home was very tidy and even smelled nice! The neighborhood was very quiet and pleasant and was minutes away from a quaint downtown and the Missouri River. Beds were comfortable, kitchen and bathrooms were very clean. The owners communication was timely and responsive. We would return without hesitation!`,

The home was decorated tastefully. It met every need we had, and it was very comfortable. We spent mornings and evenings on the comfortable screened porch, listening to the birds. Robert let us know about many local attractions and helped us find restaurants. I highly recommend this home and host!`,

We enjoyed touring the Warm Springs Ranch, walking part of the Katy Trail including the "new" bridge, and doing the walking tour of Boonville. The old jail was especially interesting.`,

The home is very warm and inviting. Robert was a great host and very quick in responding to text and emails. Definitely made us feel at home. Will use again on future visits!`,

      review: `This house and experience was awesome!! We needed a house for one night at the last minute and this was open. For some reason I had problems online trying to secure the deal but Robert, the owner, was texting me during the process and calling Airbnb to make sure everything got done. Once we made it to the house, it was even better than what we had hoped for! The house was so clean and in order. Robert had everything marked and helpful notes throughout the house if case we needed anything. The house is on a quiet street on a culdesac. Also, the town of Boonville is awesome too! We had never been there before but it is a beautiful town with many shopping and eating establishments to choose from. I would definitely stay here if we ever get back to this area!`,

He's a great host who really goes the extra mile in making sure it's a pleasant stay. The home was clean and welcoming and Robert made sure everything was ready to go before we arrived. Booneville is a nice small town that is not too far from Columbia and the next time we're in the area we would definitely look to book again. Thanks Robert!`,
